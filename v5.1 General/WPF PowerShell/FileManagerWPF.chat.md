write a new PowerShell script to genearte a WPF XAML window that shows me files in current folder. The file name, sub-folders, size and creation and modifcation date should be shown. plus comment attribute.  I should be able to select one file and update the comment.  There should be button to add today's date as Sun 07-13-2025 for example - as Comment.

I'll help you create a PowerShell script that generates a WPF XAML window for file management with the features you requested. Let me start by exploring the workspace structure and then create the script. Now I'll create a comprehensive PowerShell script that creates a WPF window with all the features you requested. This will include a DataGrid to display files with their properties, the ability to edit comments, and a button to add today's date. I've created a comprehensive PowerShell WPF script called [`FileManagerWPF.ps1`](FileManagerWPF.ps1 ) that meets all your requirements. Here's what the script provides:

## Features:

1. **File Display**: Shows all files and folders in the current directory with:
   - File/folder name
   - Type (File or Folder)
   - Size (formatted in B, KB, MB, GB)
   - Creation date and time
   - Modification date and time
   - Comment attribute

2. **Comment Management**:
   - Comments are stored using NTFS Alternate Data Streams
   - You can select a file and edit its comment in the text box
   - Click "Update Comment" to save changes
   - Comments persist between sessions

3. **Date Addition**:
   - "Add Today's Date" button adds the current date in your requested format (e.g., "Sun 07-13-2025")
   - Appends to existing comments without overwriting

4. **Navigation**:
   - Double-click folders to navigate into them
   - Current directory is displayed at the top
   - Refresh button to reload the current directory

5. **User Interface**:
   - Clean WPF DataGrid with sortable columns
   - Status bar showing current operations
   - Alternating row colors for better readability

## How to use:

1. **Run the script**: Open PowerShell and navigate to the script directory, then run:
   ```powershell
   .\FileManagerWPF.ps1
   ```

2. **Select files**: Click on any file or folder in the grid

3. **Edit comments**: 
   - Select a file
   - Type in the comment text box
   - Click "Update Comment"

4. **Add today's date**: 
   - Select a file
   - Click "Add Today's Date" to append the current date

5. **Navigate folders**: Double-click on any folder to enter it

The script uses NTFS Alternate Data Streams to store comments, which means they're persistent and won't interfere with the actual file content. The comments are stored in a `:Comment` stream attached to each file.

Would you like me to make any modifications to the script or add additional features?

fix error Unable to find type [System.Windows.MessageBox].

## Copilot

The error "Unable to find type [System.Windows.MessageBox]" occurs because the required assembly for WPF MessageBox isn't loaded. You need to add the PresentationFramework assembly reference.

Looking at your code, you already have most of the required assemblies, but you're missing the specific reference for MessageBox. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Add the missing assembly reference** at the top of your script with the other Add-Type statements:


```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore
Add-Type -AssemblyName WindowsBase
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing  # Add this line
```
Alternative solution**: Replace `[System.Windows.MessageBox]` with `[System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]` since you're already loading System.Windows.Forms:

Find these lines in your code:

```powershell
[System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show(...)
```
d replace them with:

```powershell
[System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show(...)
```
 second approach is often more reliable since Windows.Forms.MessageBox is more widely supported across different PowerShell environments.

**Recommended fix**: Use the Windows.Forms MessageBox since you're already loading that assembly. Replace all instances of `[System.Windows.MessageBox]` with `[System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]` in your script.

wpf should be used. is MessageBox part of WPF?

## Copilot

Yes, MessageBox is part of WPF, but you need to reference it correctly. In WPF, the MessageBox class is `System.Windows.MessageBox`, but you need to ensure the correct assembly is loaded.

The issue in your code is that you're already loading the correct assemblies, but sometimes PowerShell needs an explicit reference. Here's the fix:

````powershell
// filepath: c:\Proj\PowerShell\PowerShell v5.1\WPF [FileManagerWPF.ps1](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
# File Manager WPF Application
# This script creates a WPF window to display and manage files in the current directory
# Features: Display files/folders, show properties, edit comments, add today's date

Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore
Add-Type -AssemblyName WindowsBase
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms

# Add explicit reference to System.Windows for MessageBox
if (-not ([System.Management.Automation.PSTypeName]'System.Windows.MessageBox').Type) {
    Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework
}

// ...existing code...



There is no direct .NET property for the "Comments" attribute (the "Comments" field you see in Windows Explorer file properties) for arbitrary files.
This metadata is stored as an NTFS Alternate Data Stream for some file types, or in file-specific metadata (like EXIF for images, or ID3 for MP3s), or in the Windows Property System for certain file types.

For general files (e.g., .txt, .ps1, etc.), you can use the Windows Property System via COM interop:
Get/Set Comments using Windows Property System (Shell32/COM):
Note:
// Add reference to Shell32 (COM) in your project
using Shell32;

// Get comment
Shell shell = new Shell();
Folder folder = shell.NameSpace(@"C:\Path\To\File");
FolderItem item = folder.ParseName("filename.txt");
string comment = folder.GetDetailsOf(item, 14); // 14 is the index for Comments

// Set comment (requires using IPropertyStore via PInvoke, not directly supported in .NET)


The index for "Comments" (14) may vary by Windows version and language.
Setting comments programmatically is complex and requires COM interop with the Windows Property System (IPropertyStore), which is not exposed directly in .NET Standard/Framework.
PowerShell Example (using Shell.Application):


$shell = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
$folder = $shell.Namespace('C:\Path\To\File')
$file = $folder.ParseName('filename.txt')
$comment = $folder.GetDetailsOf($file, 14)
Setting the comment is not supported via this COM object; you need to use the Windows API (IPropertyStore).

Summary Table
Method	Get Comment	Set Comment	Notes
.NET (FileInfo)	❌	❌	Not supported
Shell32 COM	✔️	❌	Get only, index may vary
IPropertyStore	✔️	✔️	Requires PInvoke/COM interop, complex
PowerShell ADS	✔️	✔️	Custom, not visible in Explorer
For most scripting, storing comments in an NTFS alternate data stream (as your script does) is the most portable and reliable method for arbitrary files.
